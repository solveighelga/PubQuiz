# PubQuiz

I decided to make a card game with cards that flip over when active. I wanted them to flip back quickly so the answer becomes hidden when you stop pressing the card.

# Animation

I use @keyframes for my h1 and h2 to determine the time it starts and ends.

I played around with different transition speed and transform degrees. 

### Hope you enjoy! :)
